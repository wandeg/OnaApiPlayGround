OnaApiPlayGround
================

This is a project I'm using to play around with the Ona Api to see what I can come up with.
The main point of this is to practice my Data Analyis and Visualization skills. I will also be using this to learn Flask.

After playing around with the data, I'm hoping to produce something similar to this - http://blog.ona.io/general/2015/01/01/github-africa-2015.html - using data fetched from the Api.
